# Alundra datas analyser
This project is fork from [surixurient](https://github.com/surixurient/alundra).
The aim is to understand how the data in the Alundra game is structured and use my game engine [CasaEngineMonoGame](https://github.com/xcasadio/CasaEngineMonogame) to play it.

## Source code analyser
- I use Ghidra to analyse the source code, the project is in the folder Ghidra.
- I use pcsx-redux to debug the code

## Datas analyser
Open GraphicsTool.sln and open the Datas.bin file (you'll need to extract the data from your Alundra game).
