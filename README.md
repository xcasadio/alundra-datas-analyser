This project is fork from [surixurient](https://github.com/surixurient/alundra).

## Objectives
- Understand how Alundra game data is structured.
- Use my game engine [CasaEngineMonoGame] (https://github.com/xcasadio/CasaEngineMonogame) to recreate the game.

## Contributors
You are welcome, you can contact me with [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/xcasadio/alundra-datas-analyser/discussions).

# Tools
## Source code analyser
- I use Ghidra to analyse the source code, the project is in the folder Ghidra.
- I use pcsx-redux to debug the code

## Datas analyser
Open GraphicsTool.sln and open the Datas.bin file (you'll need to extract the data from your Alundra game).
